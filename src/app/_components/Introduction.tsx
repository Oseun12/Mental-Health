            Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, affecting how we think, feel, and behave in daily life. 
            It determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Good mental health enables individuals to 
            cope with lifeâ€™s challenges, work productively, and contribute meaningfully to their communities.

                Why is Mental Health Important?
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Mental health is just as important as physical health. Poor mental health can lead to a range of issues, including 
                stress, anxiety, depression, and even physical illnesses such as heart disease. On the other hand, good mental health 
                fosters resilience, enhances productivity, and strengthens relationships.
