                    Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, affecting how we think, feel, and behave in daily life. 
                    It determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Good mental health enables individuals to 
                    cope with lifeâ€™s challenges, work productively, and contribute meaningfully to their communities.
